User Stories: 

The user wants a page where they can easily go to their saved recipes or a page where they can add recipes to their saved recipes. [Team Story]
Use Case: By running the program, a jframe is opened where there are two buttons "favourites" and "Search Recipes".
Use Case: The "Favourites" button opens a new jframe that displays the users saved recipes. These will be stored locally on the users computer.
Use Case: The "Search Recipes" button opens a new jframe that allows the user to search for recipes based on their needs. For example they can search the main ingredient, or search recipes based on their macro requirements.

The user has saved some of their favorite recipes in the past but is now on a diet. They will be able to filter their recipes according to their macro requirements, allergies, type of diet, the number of ingredients, and the main ingredient in the recipe. The user should also be able to delete recipes from their favorites. [Team Story] 

Use Case: On the "Favourites" Jframe, there are several text fields which allow the user to filter.

If there is something unhealthy in the recipe the user chooses, there is a message specifying it, such as too much sugar or too much sodium. [Huzaifah’s Story] 
User Story: For sugar: The user clicks on the recipe he wants to create. It opens a new jframe specifying details of the recipe, and if there is more than 15% daily value of a macro, it will display a warning specifying it on the recipes jframe.

Diddy has a daily goal of acros he needs to hit. He can make a meal planner and add meals to it which lets him know his progress for the day. [Diddy’s Story] 

Katherine often finds herself with leftover or miscellaneous ingredients in her fridge and pantry but doesn’t know what she can make with them. Instead of browsing recipes and checking what she’s missing, she wants the app to do the reverse: input what she has and get a list of recipe matches that use at least one of those ingredients, and the recipes are listed in decreasing order of matched ingredients. (or mostly those ingredients). [Rocky’s Story]  

Nolan is partial to Chinese food, and he has many chinese recipes saved in his favourites. He also has a taste for Indian food, and he has some Indian recipes saved, although not as many. Nolan can search for a recipe to make, and he will likely see a high number of Chinese recipes at the top of his search results, with a lower number of Indian recipes. [Owen’s story]
