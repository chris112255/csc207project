User Stories: 
The user has saved some of their favorite recipes in the past but is now on a diet. They will be able to filter their recipes according to their macro requirements, allergies, type of diet, the number of ingredients, and the main ingredient in the recipe. The user should also be able to delete recipes from their favorites. [Team Story] 

If there is something unhealthy in the recipe the user chooses, there is a message specifying it, such as too much sugar or too much sodium. [Huzaifah’s Story] 

Diddy is interested in reaching a certain number of macros in a specific number of meals. Diddy can add meals into a food log and can see the macro summary, allowing him to see if he reaches his goals with these meals. [Diddy’s Story] 

Katherine often finds herself with leftover or miscellaneous ingredients in her fridge and pantry but doesn’t know what she can make with them. Instead of browsing recipes and checking what she’s missing, she wants the app to do the reverse: input what she has and get a list of recipe matches that use at least one of those ingredients, and the recipes are listed in decreasing order of matched ingredients. (or mostly those ingredients). [Rocky’s Story]  

Nolan is partial to Chinese food, and he has many chinese recipes saved in his favourites. He also has a taste for Indian food, and he has some Indian recipes saved, although not as many. Nolan can search for a recipe to make, and he will likely see a high number of Chinese recipes at the top of his search results, with a lower number of Indian recipes. [Owen’s story]
