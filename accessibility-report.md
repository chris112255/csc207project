Project Accessibility Report

1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

  (a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

  (b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

  Principle 1: Equitable Use
  
To improve on this principle, we could implement a higher contrast color scheme. Another thing we could do is make text bigger so that most people would have no issues reading it. 

  Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
  
To allow for more flexibility in use, we could implement text to speech options. By doing so, we would lessen the need to read text and instead listen. An option to zoom in or increase a font size slider would also   increase flexibility. 

  Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
  
When designing our program, we made sure to keep text as simple and intuitive as possible. This was especially true for text on buttons as such text is responsible for communicating to the user what their action would do, whether it be opening a new menu or screen they would need to navigate.

  Principle 4: Perceptible Information
  
Our program includes images of every recipe before clicking into them to provide users another way to understand what each meal might be without even reading the name. In order to abide by this principle more closely, we could include icons for certain buttons like for “Save Recipe”. Additionally, we could add an auditory feedback to when a button is clicked so users are aware that the button was clicked. We could also add text that says “loading…” when loading is occurring instead of a blank screen so the user is aware of what is happening. 

  Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
  
We incorporated this principle by allowing users the ability to reverse actions such as saving a recipe easily through replacing the “Save Recipe” button with a “Remove Recipe” button allowing quick and easy access to users to reverse a mistaken click. Furthermore, at the top of the window, we have buttons to the four main screens so users can quickly navigate to any of the four screens if they accidentally clicked on the wrong one from the main page. 

  Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
  
The save recipe feature was designed exactly for this. By allowing users the ability to save recipes, users can save their favourite recipes and or recipes they plan on trying after. This is also saved so even after re-running the application, user’s saved recipes will remain, saving users the hassle of having to search for recipes manually every time. Filters in the explore recipes page and saved recipes page allow for users to quickly pinpoint recipes that would appeal to them with minimal effort. 

  Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
  
As our program is digital, this principle doesn’t really apply to it.


2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

  Our program can help anyone find recipes that they might want to try. However, we designed our program for those involved in physical training and as such would market it towards them. Such people need to reach certain goals in calories and protein among other things, while limiting fats and carbohydrates. Our program also includes a meal planner where users can input such goals and see how their chosen meals match up to those goals, allowing for users to better plan meals. 


3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

  Unfortunately, our program in its current state is most likely to be less used by people who are blind, visually impaired, and those who have issues with motor skills. As our program does not have support for screen readers or any sort of sound feedback, blind users would not be able to use the program. Similarly, visually impaired people might have trouble reading the relatively small fonts and navigating menus due to a lack of zooming and high contrast color schemes. Additionally, people who struggle with motor skills might have trouble navigating menus due to the relatively small buttons and text fields.
